    YATSE 2 - A touch screen remote controller for XBMC (.NET 3.5)
    Copyright (C) 2010-2013  Tolriq (http://yatse.leetzone.org)

--------------- SOCKET Branch is the latest -------

An update on Tolriq Yatse2 - 2nd screen TFT HTPC remote control and media info
for Xbmc and Kodi.
Functioning well with Kodi Helix 14.2 and currently Isengard 15.2Beta
Some minor changes - as in the commits including a MinimiseAlways setting

In Xml settings file
<MinimiseAlways> Always Minimise Yatsee unless playback or paused.  
On stop etc Yatse disappears, 
when playback started Yatse returns fullscreen, pause it remains.
To setup - make sure MinimiseAlways is false and setup/connect to remote Kodi 
as needed.
Then once all working - change the MinimiseAlways setting.

Why?  To enable second application or fullscreen webbrowser to show something else
in between playback episodes - ie. completely custom web-page/screen showing whatever
like.  When playback starts - up pops control/timer and fanart. 

Few other settings
1. Remove old plugins - most not loading anyway
2. Comestic changes - icon/name shows compatible with Kodi
3. UnDim with Paused movie - If movie paused (and screen dim) Screen will undim until movie
restarted.
